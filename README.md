# WinInvest
Using Javascript, HTML, & CSS, my group and I created a website that encourages women to invest and promotes the inclusion of women in the finance world. It includes a budget calculator that generates financial advice based on the user's income and expenses. 
This project was built for the 2021 Hack the 6ix Hackathon.
