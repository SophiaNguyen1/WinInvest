                    Our mission is to invite and promote the inclusion of women into the finance world. Women have
                    historically been underrepresented in the world of
                    finance, which ultimately result in less financial freedom. Not only are women less aware of useful
                    financial information, but women are more conservative and hesitant with investing their money.
                    Studies have shown that women invest 40% less than men, which is something that needs to change in
                    order to achieve full economic equality for everyone.

                    With just a simple click on our budget calculator, you can enter your estimated monthly income,
                    expenses, and savings to calculate your financial health.
                    Using your personalized results, we will advise you on what financial decisions will be best for
                    you, including which investments will give you increased financial growth and independence.
